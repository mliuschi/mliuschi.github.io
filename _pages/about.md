I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Caltech, studying computer science. Currently, I am a research intern in the [Learning and Perception group](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/) at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/) and a member of [Anima Anandkumar's AI + Science lab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) at Caltech. In the past, I was also a research intern at the [University of Texas Institute for Geophysics](https://ig.utexas.edu/).

My current research lies in the theory and applications of [**neural operators**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_operators) and **operator learning**, particularly in their application to solving partial differential equations (PDEs). For instance, I have worked on developing neural operators for **forecasting in chaotic, non-stationary, and stochastic time-dependent systems**. I am very passionate about the scientific applications of machine learning and have worked on using machine learning to forecast climate tipping points, estimating glacial ice thickness, and characterizing features of the Martian terrain.

During my undergrad, I have been very grateful for support from the [Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship](https://www.mellon.org/mmuf). I was also a recipient of the [2024 Barry Goldwater scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/).
